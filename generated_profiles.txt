**Ethan James Hylton** studies at Goldsmiths, University of London and will intern with the IndyStar newsroom.Summary of their data skills: I've used Echarts, chart.js, and Flourish in my data journalism work. I used Echarts and chart.js to create an interactive refugee information dashboard. Using these tools I was able to integrate various customization options like tooltips and zoom features. This made it easier for users to explore the data at different granularities, enhancing the storytelling aspect by allowing them to engage directly with the data. 
I used Flourish to create animated visualizations to illustrate the growing trend of journalist being killed globally in specific countries for the past 20 years. Flourish's variety of templates and customization options helped me transform raw data into visually appealing and engaging stories, with interactive elements like scroll-triggered animations that captured the audienceâ€™s attention and guided them through the data..
**Apurva Mahajan** studies at University of Maryland and will intern with the The Detroit News newsroom.Summary of their data skills: Python - Since March, I've been developing a news application that displays every sponsored congressional trip taken since 2012. I used Python's Flask web framework for the backend, and HTML, CSS and some Javascript for the frontend. 

In the spring, I coded a Python web scraper that gets University of Maryland Police Alerts and sends a message in Slack to alert reporters. Though this did not result in a public-facing story, I used this scraper to create an internal newsroom-wide tool. I also can do basic data analysis in Python.

R - I am comfortable scraping, cleaning and analyzing data in R. At the moment, I primarily fact-check and edit other reporters' code, analysis and graphics, so I use R to run through someone's Excel or Python analysis and ensure I reach the same answer with a different process.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript - I'm proficient in HTML and CSS and have used them for front-end design on multiple websites/apps and to customize tooltips and designs in third-party tools such as Flourish, Datawrapper and even Mailchimp. I am a beginner in JavaScript, but have used it to make news applications more interactive through features like fuzzy search/string matching. I've also used Javascript libraries such as Leaflet, Datatables and Chart.js for locator maps, tables and data visualizations in my news apps. I'm currently learning D3.js.

Excel, Google Sheets - I use these tools to perform quick data analysis, and they help me add another level of reporting to otherwise quick-turn and straightforward stories by supplementing them with data to contextualize local news with nationwide trends.

Flourish and Datawrapper - I used Flourish and Datawrapper to create graphics and supplement my reporting for daily stories at the Frederick News-Post that originally did not require me to do data analysis. For The Diamondback, I created graphics and maps for our election coverage and coded to create custom GeoJSONs to display mixed electoral seat allocation for a hexmap of U.S. election results.

ArcGIS, QGIS - Though I have yet to apply my GIS skills for a story, I'm a GIS minor and have taken remote sensing coursework. I can comfortably analyze spatial data and satellite data using ArcGIS and QGIS.

Adobe Illustrator - I have experience in creating static graphics in Adobe Illustrator and ai2html. This tool allows me to create custom graphics and execute designs that I could not otherwise with Flourish and Datawrapper's capacities..

**Lauren Lifke** studies at University of New Mexico and will intern with the Maryland Matters newsroom.Summary of their data skills: Tableau -- I created interactive maps of crimes that were reported at UNM. Readers can hover a mouse over color-coded spots where crimes were recorded to read more about where, when and what happened.

Google Sheets/Excel -- I sorted crime data into refined umbrella categories. I used that data to create the Tableau maps.

I used Google Sheets to sort out survey responses about which issues our readers care about the most. Respondents were given three questions about which issues they cared about the most, second-most, and third-most. I used Sheets to create a ranked-choice system that evaluated which issues readers care about overall, and I sorted that data by race, gender and other categories. 

Datawrapper -- I created tables that listed election issues that readers care about. I also used Datawrapper to create bar graphs depicting crime data at UNM over time. 

R -- I use this software to determine whether there are correlations between two or more data elements for my statistics classes. I create visualizations that depict the relationship between data, and I use the visualizations to interpret the significance of the data in simpler terms.

JMP Statistical Software -- I use this software for the same purposes as R, but I create more simple and easy-to-interpret charts and graphs using this software..
