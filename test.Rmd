<div class="card-body">
Studies at Goldsmiths, University of London and will intern with the IndyStar newsroom. Summary of their data skills: I've used Echarts, chart.js, and Flourish in my data journalism work. I used Echarts and chart.js to create an interactive refugee information dashboard. Using these tools I was able to integrate various customization options like tooltips and zoom features. This made it easier for users to explore the data at different granularities, enhancing the storytelling aspect by allowing them to engage directly with the data. 
I used Flourish to create animated visualizations to illustrate the growing trend of journalist being killed globally in specific countries for the past 20 years. Flourish's variety of templates and customization options helped me transform raw data into visually appealing and engaging stories, with interactive elements like scroll-triggered animations that captured the audience's attention and guided them through the data.

Studies at University of Maryland and will intern with the The Detroit News newsroom. Summary of their data skills: Python - Since March, I've been developing a news application that displays every sponsored congressional trip taken since 2012. I used Python's Flask web framework for the backend, and HTML, CSS and some Javascript for the frontend. 

In the spring, I coded a Python web scraper that gets University of Maryland Police Alerts and sends a message in Slack to alert reporters. Though this did not result in a public-facing story, I used this scraper to create an internal newsroom-wide tool. I also can do basic data analysis in Python.

R - I am comfortable scraping, cleaning and analyzing data in R. At the moment, I primarily fact-check and edit other reporters' code, analysis and graphics, so I use R to run through someone's Excel or Python analysis and ensure I reach the same answer with a different process.

Studies at University of Arkansas and will intern with the The Marshall Project newsroom. Summary of their data skills: I'm currently learning R and Python to better my data analyzation and cleaning skills. I have taken data sets to aid in my writing for stories about AI Child Sexual Abuse Material Law in Arkansas, Sexual Violence on College Campuses, Suicide Statistics in College Students, and, more recently, I have evaluated my University police Clery Report in 2024 and created a data visualization using Tableau and Adobe.

Studies at The College of New Jersey and will intern with the NJ Advance Media newsroom. Summary of their data skills: I frequently use Microsoft Excel to compile, organize, and analyze data. This tool helps me better understand datasets and apply them to the larger story. 

I use SQL and Python for every step of a data-heavy project, including scraping, compiling, cleaning, analyzing, and visualization. These tools aid with datasets that are too big or complex for Excel. It has helped me uncover truth in datasets and make information more easily readable for audiences.

Studies at University of New Mexico and will intern with the Maryland Matters newsroom. Summary of their data skills: Tableau -- I created interactive maps of crimes that were reported at UNM. Readers can hover a mouse over color-coded spots where crimes were recorded to read more about where, when and what happened.

Google Sheets/Excel -- I sorted crime data into refined umbrella categories. I used that data to create the Tableau maps.

I used Google Sheets to sort out survey responses about which issues our readers care about the most. Respondents were given three questions about which issues they cared about the most, second-most, and third-most. I used Sheets to create a ranked-choice system that evaluated which issues readers care about overall, and I sorted that data by race, gender and other categories. 

Datawrapper -- I created tables that listed election issues that readers care about. I also used Datawrapper to create bar graphs depicting crime data at UNM over time. 

R -- I use this software to determine whether there are correlations between two or more data elements for my statistics classes. I create visualizations that depict the relationship between data, and I use the visualizations to interpret the significance of the data in simpler terms.

JMP Statistical Software -- I use this software for the same purposes as R, but I create more simple and easy-to-interpret charts and graphs using this software.

Studies at University of Maryland, College Park and will intern with the Advertising Specialty Institute newsroom. Summary of their data skills: R: I use R to clean large, messy datasets and analyze them for key findings to enhance my storytelling. In the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism, I web scrape train schedules and combine them into one CSV, join data frames for analysis, use the ggplot library to create graphs of my findings and write functions to create data frames of specific chemicals filtered out from a database of toxic substances traveling on trains.

Flourish/Datawrapper: I visualize data with Flourish and Datawrapper and embed them into stories, adding a multimedia element that helps explain complicated information and figures in a way words cannot. I've created custom heat maps by uploading GeoJSON files, stacked bar charts, line graphs and more to explain figures and trends to readers. 

Python: I used Python to interact with a Census API, retrieving detailed demographic information such as population statistics, income distribution and education levels.

R SQLite: wrote SQL code and harnessed the SQLite library in R to pull data from a SQL database for the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism.

HTML/CSS: used HTML and CSS for front-end design and to create my portfolio website.

Summary of their data skills: I have used Datawrapper to visualize how prevalent straw purchasing is when it comes to gun trafficking crimes committed by women. By making a bar graph, the graphic clearly showed the reader that the gun crime committed most frequently by women was straw purchasing, which supplemented the narrative aspects of the story.

I have also used Datawrapper to map addresses in Oklahoma City that were offered less than the FCC's definition of broadband by internet providers. While this story did not run, the graphic was able to show that dots were clustered in certain parts of the city which correlated with other demographic factors.

As someone with a background in data, how to uncover invisible patterns and stories from massive amounts of data is my interest and specialty. When I want readers to pay attention to certain patterns or special events in a data set, I will create various data charts to support my interpretation. Or when the dataset is so large that a simple narrative can't give readers the full picture, I create infographics to make the data more accessible and logical.
